**Add a code comment block describing your function before you start writing the code. All group members should participate in each question but you should switch drivers as you go.**

Introductions: Your name and top super power.

0. Describe a function in your own words.

1. Write a function that logs "Hello World" when called.

2. Write a function that takes in a number and logs "Hello World" that number of times (e.g. 2 would log "Hello World" two times). NOTE: When console logging the same thing twice, you'll see a little number to the left of the log rather than the text twice.

3. Write a function that takes in a number and returns true if it's greater than zero, false if less than 0.

4. Write a function that takes in a number (0 - 6) as an argument and returns the day of the week (dayOfWeekToString(0) would return "Sunday", dayOfWeekToString(2) would return "Tuesday"). NOTE: Use if / else if or switch for each day of the week within the function.

5. Write a function that returns the current day of the week. NOTE: You will want to search for `getDay()` on MDN. (getDayOfWeek() would return 'Wednesday'). There may be a lot of overlap with the previous function, can you use the previous function to simplify your code? 

Stretch (optional)
6. Write a function that logs the number of times it's been called to the console. (callCounter(); would log 'You have called this function 1 time'. Running it again would log 'You have called this function 2 times'.) This one is more challenging that it sounds but should generate some good conversation!

7. Write a function that takes in an Array and a string. Return the number of times you found the string in the Array. countStringInArray('green', ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'green']) would return 2 

NOTE: Use a loop rather than Array built in functions.
